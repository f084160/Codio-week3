First code

Open the file "MakingPi.py". Add the missing import line to make the printout of maths revision work


Second code

Degrees in Centigrade C can be converted to Fahrenheit F using the formula
F=1.8xC+32
Write two functions in the file Temperature.py:
centToFaren which takes Centigrade as input and returns Fahrenheit;
farenToCent which takes Farenheit as input and returns Centigrade.
You must use these function names for the tests to work.

Third code

In the Imperial system weight is measured in stones and pounds. There are 14 pounds in a stone.
We can convert to the metric system using the following formula which is correct to 2 decimal places:
20 stone=127kg
 
Write two functions:
imperialToMetric which goes from imperial to metric. This should have two input arguments (stone and pounds) and one output (kg).
metricToImperial which foes from metric to imperial. This should have one input argument (kg) and two outputs (stone and pounds)
You must use these function names for the tests to work.
