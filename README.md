First code
Open the file "MakingPi.py". Add the missing import line to make the printout of maths revision work


Second code
Degrees in Centigrade C can be converted to Fahrenheit F using the formula
F=1.8xC+32
Write two functions in the file Temperature.py:
centToFaren which takes Centigrade as input and returns Fahrenheit;
farenToCent which takes Farenheit as input and returns Centigrade.
You must use these function names for the tests to work.
