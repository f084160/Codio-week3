# Degrees in Centigrade (C) can be converted to Fahrenheit (F) using the formula
# F = 1:8 x C + 32
# Write two functions in this file: 
# - centToFaren which takes Centigrade as input and returns Fahrenheit;
# - farenToCent: which takes Farenheit as input and returns Centigrade.
# You must use these function names for the tests to work in the Codio Guide.
